    "description": "Ram Charan’s Game Changer is gearing up for release on January 10 from early morning shows starting at 4 am in Telangana. The US Premieres are set to start on January 9th, but the latest update from the US distributors hints at a delay due to unavoidable circumstances.\nThe US distributors dropped a tweet a while ago regarding the Game Changer content in the USA. According to them the Telugu version of Game Changer was received on January 8th and has been successfully delivered to all electronically downloaded sites the night of Jan 8th itself.\nHowever, there seem to be delays in delivering content drives physically to some sites in respective locations. The delays are caused due to the wildfire in the Los Angeles area and the snowstorm in the Midwest. Some hard drives are currently stuck at cargo hubs.\n\nThe distributors are said to be trying every possible option to ensure the drives are delivered to theaters on time. Meanwhile, some fans from a few locations have been complaining about the show cancelations.\n\nRam Charan’s Game Changer is directed by Shankar and produced by Dil Raju. Thaman composed the music for the movie. Kiara Advani plays the female lead. Anjali, Srikanth, Sj Suryah, and others appear in crucial roles.\n\n",
